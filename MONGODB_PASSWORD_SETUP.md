# How to Find/Reset Your MongoDB Atlas Password

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Option 1: Reset Your Password (Recommended if you don't remember it)

1. **Go to MongoDB Atlas**
   - Visit: https://cloud.mongodb.com/
   - Log in with your MongoDB account

2. **Navigate to Database Access**
   - In the left sidebar, look for **"Security"** section
   - Click on **"Database Access"** (it has a key icon 🔑)

3. **Find Your User**
   - You'll see a list of database users
   - Look for the user: `oubeisia_db_user`
   - If you don't see it, you might need to create a new user

4. **Edit the User**
   - Click the **"Edit"** button (pencil icon) next to `oubeisia_db_user`
   - OR click on the username itself

5. **Reset Password**
   - Scroll down to the **"Password"** section
   - Click **"Edit Password"** button
   - Choose one of these options:
     - **"Autogenerate Secure Password"** (recommended - MongoDB will create a strong password)
     - **"Enter Custom Password"** (you type your own password)
   - If you chose autogenerate, **COPY THE PASSWORD IMMEDIATELY** - you won't see it again!
   - Click **"Update User"** button at the bottom

6. **Copy the Password**
   - If you autogenerated: Copy it from the popup/display
   - If you entered custom: You already know it

7. **Update Your .env File**
   - Open `server/.env` in your project
   - Find the line: `MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://oubeisia_db_user:<db_password>@...`
   - Replace `<db_password>` with the password you just copied/created
   - **Important:** Don't include any spaces or quotes around the password
   - Save the file

8. **Restart Your Server**
   - Stop your server (Ctrl+C in the terminal)
   - Run `npm run dev` again
   - You should see "✅ Connected to MongoDB" in the console

### Option 2: Find Your Existing Password (If you remember setting it)

If you already set a password and remember it, you can't view it in MongoDB Atlas (for security reasons). You have two options:

**Option A:** Use the password you remember
- Just replace `<db_password>` in `server/.env` with your remembered password

**Option B:** Reset it (if you forgot)
- Follow Option 1 above to reset the password

### Troubleshooting

**If you can't find "Database Access":**
- Make sure you're logged into the correct MongoDB Atlas account
- Check that you have the right permissions (you might need to be the organization owner)

**If you see "oubeisia_db_user" but can't edit it:**
- You might not have admin permissions
- Contact your MongoDB Atlas organization admin

**If the connection still fails after updating password:**
- Make sure there are no spaces in the password in the .env file
- Make sure you didn't include quotes around the password
- Check that your IP address is whitelisted (see Network Access below)

---

### Network Access (Important!)

Your IP address must be whitelisted for MongoDB Atlas to accept connections:

1. In MongoDB Atlas, go to **"Security"** → **"Network Access"** (globe icon 🌐)
2. Click **"Add IP Address"**
3. Choose one:
   - **"Add Current IP Address"** (if you're on the same computer)
   - **"Allow Access from Anywhere"** (0.0.0.0/0) - less secure but easier for development
4. Click **"Confirm"**

**Note:** If you chose "Allow Access from Anywhere", MongoDB will show a warning. For development/testing, this is usually fine. For production, use specific IP addresses.

---

### Example of Correct .env Format:

**Before (broken):**
```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://oubeisia_db_user:<db_password>@cluster0.kfugj6n.mongodb.net/brainai?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
```

**After (working):**
```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://oubeisia_db_user:MySecurePassword123!@cluster0.kfugj6n.mongodb.net/brainai?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
```

**Important Notes:**
- No spaces around the password
- No quotes around the password
- If your password has special characters, they should be URL-encoded (but usually MongoDB handles this automatically)
- The password goes between the `:` and `@` symbols

---

### After Setting Up:

1. Restart your server
2. Check the console for: `✅ Connected to MongoDB: brainai`
3. Try sending a message in the chat
4. Check the console for: `✅ Saved conversation to MongoDB`
5. Go to the Conversation Logs page - you should see your conversations!

---

### Still Having Issues?

If you're still getting errors:
1. Check the server console for specific error messages
2. Verify the password doesn't have any extra spaces
3. Make sure Network Access is configured
4. Try resetting the password again
